# ballistic_montecarlo legacy code
This subrepo contains the legacy matlab code for ballistic montecarlo. It runs off of two libraries: 
fab_feature_code generates the device geometry, stable_bsweep_bandstructure models electron transport in 
this device according to the bandstructure of the material.
